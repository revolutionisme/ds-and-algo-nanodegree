Task0: 
O(1) -> Fixed computation, no impact of number of inputs

Task1: 
O(n+m) -> Single iteration depending on the number of items in both the files.
m -> inputs in texts.csv, n -> inputs in calls.csv

Task2:
O(n) -> Single iteration over calls.csv and another iteration to find the max value in the doctionary, so technically O(2n), but simple Big O is n

Task3:
O(n+plogp) -> Single iteration over calls.csv and then sorting the set which is much smaller than n in our case
n -> inputs in calls.csv, p -> entries in set area_code

Task4:
O(n+m+plogp)
Single iteration over calls.csv and texts.csv, and then sorting the potential spam numbers set which is much smaller than n in our case
n -> inputs in calls.csv, m-> inputs in texts.csv, p -> entries in set potential spam numbers
