The negative of the numbers is inserted in the heap to create a max heap, such that whenever a heap pop operation is done, the minimum is fetched and its sign is reversed. 

Time Complexity:
O(nlogn) - for creating the max heap, where n is the number of entries in the input list

Space Complexity:
O(n) - A new heap of max size n is created.
