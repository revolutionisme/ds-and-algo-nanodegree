3 new list which keep track of each 0's, 1's and 2's and then they are appended togethe to create asorted list

Time Complexity:
O(n) -  One pass over the for loop, where n is the number of entries in the input list 

Space Complexity:
O(n) - as 3 new sub lists are created which add up to n, which is the number of entries in the input list
