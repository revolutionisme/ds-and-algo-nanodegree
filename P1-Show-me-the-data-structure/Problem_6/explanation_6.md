For union and intersection of the linked list, the lists are traversed and then the union and intersection is calculated using the operations on the set for all the values.


Time Complexity:
union() - O(n) - Traverse both the list once and add the values in the set, 
intersection() - O(n) - Traverse both the list once and in the second list traversal, check and add value 

Space Complexity:
O(n) - Add space for the set for the values in the lists.
