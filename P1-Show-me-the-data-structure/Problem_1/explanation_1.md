The data structure used consists of a dictionary which consists the key-value pair and a list which takes care of the ordering of the cache keys. Both the get and set operations are fixed time - O(1) 

Time Complexity:
get() - O(1) 
set() - O(1)

Space Complexity: 
    O(n) - To maintain the extra list for order

For individual functions - 
get() - O(1) 
set() - O(1)
